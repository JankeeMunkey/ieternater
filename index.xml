      <description>I am Jank. Jank the Munkey. I go by that on the web, but my real name is Skylar Houghton. I have a passion for IT and found that automation is where i really excel.
Automation with a focus on security. Locking things down and ensuring things are secure on the web are a niche i feel at home with.
I started this project to show others things that I have learned in the process and the legacy I have with them as well.</description>
